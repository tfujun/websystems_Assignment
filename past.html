        <p>
            Previous to starting my Computer Sciencedegree I have had no experience coding.
            I had my first experience with Java and Python doing Programming 1 in my first semester of university last year,
            it was at first hard, as everything is when you first start, however I was able to grasp the various concepts of object orientated programming
            with the help of my tutors and fellow classmates. However I would argue that the hardest parts of my course thus far have been
            the mathematics subjects, particularly 37181 Discrete Maths and 37132 IMAM.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <p>
            So far, my programming experience encompasses a variety of small projects including;
            <ul>
                <li>Building a database management system in java</li>
                <li>Creating a linked list with utility commands in java</li>
                <li>Utilised twitter API to create a recent tweets feed for a website in python</li>
                <li>Created a simple command-line calculator in swift</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
