        <p>
            In the future, I hope to learn more about how to create and maintain software and applications, utilising
            the skills I have learned studying Computer Science to create something 
            <span class = "spectacularFlavourText">SPECTACULAR</span>.
            <br></br>
            I want to work in the technology field, specifically in a software engineering role as I love back-end development
            and creating software to do things, applying mathematics and algorithms to my work to extract the most out of technology.
            I want to expand my expertise in applications development, specifically with mobile apps and back-end web development,
            focusing on creating tools and solving problems using code.
            <br></br>
            Eventually I aspire to become a full-stack developer, however I believe that goal is still a long 
            way off, as I would like to firstly focus on one part of software engineering. However the experience I have
            accumulated thus far in front-end development has motivated me to take on this endeavour towards this goal.
