        <h3>A short reflection of website design;</h3>
        <p>The design of my website has followed a minimalistic, uncluttered design choice.
            I chose to keep the background of my pages white, complemented by a beige navigation bar spanning
            the height of the page with fixed position buttons for easy navigation between the different pages 
            on the website. Everything is easily accessible with only a keyboard, and images are complimented by
            text explanations for accessiblity.
            <br></br>
            The website has a simple structure; it's plain, easy to navigate and text is formatted to be easily
            readable on a variety of computing devices including laptops and phones. The structure of the website's 
            code is also formatted in such a way that it is easy to navigate and read, with different major sections
            of the website being divided into separate divs. 

            <!-- table; -->
            <table id = "commentsTable">
                <tr>
                    <th>HTML</th>
                    <th>CSS</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h5>Structure of code</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each web page is split into its own HTML file.</li>
                            <li>In each file, the 'header' section contains metadata for the page.</li>
                            <li>The body of each file contains all the content on the webpage,
                                the major content is then split into various divs.
                            </li>
                            <li>Each div has its own formatting in the linked CSS file</li>
                        </ul>

                    <td>
                        <h5>Structure of Stylesheet</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To accomodate the persistent navigation bar all web pages are styled
                                to leave an 18% screen space void on the left side. This is done in a 
                                universal body{} tag
                            </li>
                            <li>Each web page has its own css class for formatting, allowing one page to be 
                                modified without affecting others
                            </li>
                            <li>All flavourtext in my web pages have their own CSS id,
                                to allow each flavourtext to be modified easily within the .CSS stylesheet without
                                affecting other flavourtexts that share similar properties
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>The aesthetics of my webpages</h3>
            <h4>Index</h4>
            The index page is designed in such a way to reflect my overral personality and gives the viewer a broad
            impression of the nature of my website; it exists to not only convey information, but also entertain an audience.
            I included a meme, and when users scroll all the way to the bottom, the content engages the user, providing
            interactive functionality. (The button can be navigated to using tab).

            <h4>Past</h4>
            The past page lacks formatting and is very simplistic; this is a design choice to convey my past in programming and
            how I didn't know very much about this field before. It consists of basic paragraphs, simply an inserted image without
            optimisation for mobile devices, and a simple list. 

            <h4>Future</h4>
            The future page was designed to be a stark contrast to the 'Past' page. I included a background image of stars,
            signifying the vast and many opportunities I hope exist in this field, and have included formatting again. I included
            yet another image with a funny caption to signify that no matter what the future holds, I will always love humour 
            and witty jokes.
